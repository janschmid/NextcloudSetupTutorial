# NextcloudSetupTutorial
This tutorial is part of the course Linux for embedded objects 2 at SDU in Odense.
This repository does not contain any source code, only a ["how to" wiki](https://github.com/janschmid/NextcloudSetupTutorial/wiki/Setup-Nextcloud-with-reverse-proxy).

I hope sharing the information will help other people to setup a self hosted cloud.
If you find this tutorial useful, please leave a star :-)
